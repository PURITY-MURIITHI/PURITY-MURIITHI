## My Learning Goals
### This Semester
My **Goal** for this *Semester* is to learn basic `syntax and code.`\
[My Github profile page link](https://github.com/PURITY-MURIITHI)\
[This has been useful in my data science journey](https://www.anaconda.com/)  

Things I want to learn:
- Python
- SQL
- PowerBI

Making a commit in Git;
1. Modify files: Make changes to your code in your working directory.
2. Check status: Run git status to see which files have been modified.
3. Stage changes: Use git add <file> to stage specific files, or git add . to stage all changes for the next commit.
4. Commit changes: Run git commit -m "Your descriptive message" to create the commit with a message in the local repository.
