Making a commit in Git;
1. Modify files: Make changes to your code in your working directory.
2. Check status: Run git status to see which files have been modified.
3. Stage changes: Use git add <file> to stage specific files, or git add . to stage all changes for the next commit.
4. Commit changes: Run git commit -m "Your descriptive message" to create the commit with a message in the local repository.
5. Verify the commit: Run git status or git log to view commit history.
